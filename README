## Introduction

When brewing beer, controlling the temperature of fermentation can help control the types of flavors produced. 
I had an old chest freezer, which I had previously used with an arduino-based temperature control system. This system 
wasn't connected to the internet though. This repository uses a 
[Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi-dev-kit) to connect the temperature control 
system to the internet.
